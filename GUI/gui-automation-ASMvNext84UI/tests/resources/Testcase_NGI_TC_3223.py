Description: Verify memory attributes on m420 and m620 blade server, compare listed memory with memory listed in HW resources in iDRAC for the server.
                Not all attributes are visible through iDRAC, but confirmed those that are able to be queried there, such as speed, size, quantity.. 
Test Flow    : 1) Login as admin.
               2) Get the Blade server information from the main page.
               3) Open the iDRAC for specified server and get the attributes information from iDRAC page.
               4) compare the attributes values from both the pages.
